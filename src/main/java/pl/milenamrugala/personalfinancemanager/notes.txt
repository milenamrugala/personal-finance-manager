Repository: A repository is a Java class that provides an abstraction
layer over a persistent data store, such as a database.
In other words, it acts as a bridge between the application and the database.
The repository class typically contains methods for querying, inserting,
updating, and deleting data from the database.
The Spring Boot framework provides support for several popular database
technologies, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and more.
Service: A service is a Java class that contains business logic
that operates on data obtained from a repository or other sources.
In other words, it contains the application's core functionality,
such as data processing, validation, and manipulation.
The service class typically contains methods that perform these tasks
and may interact with one or more repositories to retrieve or persist data.

Controller: A controller is a Java class that handles incoming HTTP
requests and produces outgoing HTTP responses. In other words,
it acts as an interface between the user and the application, receiving
requests and sending responses. The controller class typically contains methods annotated with @RequestMapping or similar annotations that map to specific URLs and HTTP methods. When a request matching the mapping is received, the method is executed, and a response is returned to the user.

In the context of the Spring Boot framework, these three
components are often used together to build web applications.
The repository is responsible for interacting with the database,
the service implements the application's business logic,
and the controller handles incoming requests and sends
responses back to the user. The Spring Boot framework provides
support for integrating these components seamlessly and efficiently,
making it easier to build robust and scalable web applications.
